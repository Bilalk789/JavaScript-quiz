# JavaScript-Quiz
## Project 
In this project we were challenged with making a online quiz, with an active timer, a score, and multiple questions.
## Design
There was no starter code for this project, I had to make the layout, and all the files so it would flow directly into the html without any issues. However, the hard part of it was making sure the quiz worked and went through the questions easily. Using JavaScript was also very difficult at first but with deep amount of research it became a little easier. I used resources such as, MDN, GeeksforGeeks, Google(for everyhting), and the lessons from the program.
## Closing 
Hopefully the code runs decently, and the quiz runs and gives a scores at the end.
## User Error
A few of my errors are the highscores, HS page, and the timer.
